# Earthquake Intensity Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains code for analysis of historical earthquake intensity data to:
1. Identify source parameters for historical earthquake events using the codes estimate_magnitude.py and bayesian _analysis.py
2. Test the performance of earthquake hazard maps with historical intensity data.

The code has been devleoped for analysis of historical earthquake events in Indonesia, and to test the 2010 and 2017 National Seismic Hazard Assessments (Irsyam et al., 2010; 2017).
